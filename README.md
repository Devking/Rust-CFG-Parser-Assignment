# Rust CFG Parser
## CS6353 Spring 2015 Assignment 2

This repository tracks some of the Rust programming that I worked on during the spring of 2015 as part of my graduate CS6353 Programming Languages course. For this assignment, I was tasked with writing a very simplistic CFG (Context-Free Grammar) parser using a new programming language. The language we selected was Rust Beta, and we were given about two weeks to learn the language and complete the assignment.

Note that Rust Beta lacked many of the niceities that Rust today includes. For more details on the assignment specs, see the PDF included in this repository.
